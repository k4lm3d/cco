Welcome! My name is **K4LM3D** (/ka:md/) and this is my gamer profile website and blog. I pretty much play text-based MMORPGs, CYOAs, and ARGs, and I blog about my experience in there in a role player way. According to [The Quantic Lab](https://quantic.page.link/h5ioQWnBvFZi84cr7), I'm a ***Gladiator*** type of gamer.

I, also, support indie games and small group of developers by playing their games, and contributing to their work such as keeping the community friendly and non-toxic.

Thanks for stopping by. I will be posting more gaming related contents and experience here. Hope you stay tuned for updates.
