<!-- *"Someday, I can live finacially stable. Right now, all I have to do is work hard for my dreams."* -->

In just one command from the computer, I withdrew 3,000 bitcoins from my account. "This is enough for five days," I said to myself.

I walk for a couple of minutes and then, I saw a familiar face from a far. "█████? I'm pretty sure that's him but what is he doing here?"

"Huh, maybe I'm just hungry and hallucinating right now. There's no way the commander is living here, right? He's wealthy. Impossible!"

I go to the nearest convinience store and bought food. When I got home, I turned on my computer and log on to their private server through the terminal.

"It was him!?" I exlamed. "He mentioned here that he visited a slump."

"Is he... by any chance..." I creeped out. "Looking for me?"

I logged out.
