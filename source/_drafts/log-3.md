Sorry for not writing again. So many things happened. I'll just continue with what I've left on my second log.

After that night, I didn't see him again. I messaged him and he responded for after 2 or 3 days. He said his busy with his study so he can't come. I said to him that it's alright because his study is more important. He said he will try whenever his free but that day didn't come.

One day, I saw an advertisment on a public server online about the future of Shangri-La, I joined their private server because it's interesting and I'm so curious. I was welcomed by their counselor and then after a few days, I met their leader. They called him, 'Commander'. He guided me on creating stuff on the server. They've got different monetary system there and stuff.

Commander said that to continue on their server and for the sake of Shangri-La's future, I have to to join a powerful gang. I remembered that met someone a long time ago. She is a leader of a large gang. I don't know if they're powerful but she is also on the private server so I contacted her and she accepted me wholeheartedly on her gang.

Then, I learned that her gang was so friendly and they love to help other players. I'm actually glad I did join her gang because my worries started to decrease after that day. I'll talk about that worries someday but not for now.

Back on that private server, there are 4 factions. I will not mention all of them. I will only write about the faction I joined in. So, I joined the `CORPIST` faction or Corpist Primer for some people. They are mainly from Glenda District and they are all businessman. Being a corpist, I have to work to Arasaka Bank for 3 hours. The payment is good and I can eat my favorite food, Pork Adobo, at a conviniece store near it.

Ugh, I forgot that I needed to fix my backpack. I have to scavenge and recycle again tomorrow for Tech scraps. Sorry but I have to go now.

### Paraphrased

I apologize for not writing again. A lot of things happened. I'll just continue from where I left off on my second log.

After that night, I did not see him again. I messaged him, and he responded two or three days later. He explained that he couldn't come since he was too busy with his academics. I told him that it was fine because his studies were more important. He promised to try whenever he had free time, but that day never came.

One day, I came upon an advertisement on a public server concerning the future of Shangri-La. I joined their private server since I'm interested and curious. After being greeted by their counselor, I saw their commander a few days later. They addressed him as 'Commander'. He assisted me in creating files on the server. They have several monetary systems and such.

The commander told me that in order to continue on their server and secure Shangri-La's future, I needed to join a strong gang. I remembered having met someone a long time ago. She leads a vast gang. I'm not sure if they're powerful, but she's also on the private server, so I contacted her, and she warmly welcomed me to the gang.

Then I discovered that her gang was quite kind and loved to help other people who play. I'm happy that I joined her gang since my fears began to fade after that day. I will talk about those worries later, but not now. I'll talk about those worries later, but not right now.

Back on the private server, there are four factions. I'm not going to list them all. I'll only post about the faction that I joined. So I joined the 'CORPIST' faction, sometimes known as Corpist Primer to some people. They are mostly from Glenda District and are all people in business. As an official employee, I am required to work for a total of three hours in Arasaka Bank. The rate is acceptable, and I can eat my favorite food, pork adobo, at a nearby convenience store.

Ugh, I forgot I had to change my backpack. I'll have to find and recycle again tomorrow for tech scraps. Sorry, but I have to leave now.


# FINAL

I apologize for not writing again. A lot of things happened. I'll just continue from where I left off on [my second log](/cco/log-2/).


After that night, I did not see ████████ again. I messaged him, and he responded two or three days later. He explained that he couldn't come since he was too busy with his academics. I told him that it was fine because his studies were more important. He promised to try whenever he had free time, but that day never came.

One day, I came upon an advertisement on a public server concerning the future of Shangri-La. I joined their private server out of curiousity.

After being greeted by their counselor, I met their commander a few days later. He assisted me in creating files on the server. They have several monetary systems and such.

The commander told me that in order to continue on their server and secure Shangri-La's future, I needed to join a strong gang. Then, I remembered having met someone a long time ago. She leads a vast gang. I'm not sure if they're powerful, but she's also on the private server, so I contacted her, and she warmly welcomed me to the gang.

Then I discovered that her gang was quite kind and loved to **help other people**. I'm happy that I joined her gang since my worries began to fade after that day. I will talk about those worries later. Back on the private server, there are four factions. I'm not going to list them all. I'll only post about the faction that I joined.

So I joined the `CORPIST` faction, sometimes known as *Corpist Primer* to some people. They are mostly from Glenda District and are all people in business. As an "official" member, I am required to work for a total of three hours in Arasaka Bank. The rate is acceptable, and I can eat my favorite food, pork adobo, at a nearby convenience store.

Wait, I forgot I had to change my backpack. Sorry, but I have to leave to recycle tech scraps now. Till next time.
