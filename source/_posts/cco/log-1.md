I remembered how they invited me to join their gang and welcomed me so happily. I was a novice with no friends back then so I was really glad to talk to them.

Something came up to me after that and I wasn’t able to meet them. After two days without contact, I rode a train and went to the headquarters to meet them again. I was so happy until in an instant, everything has changed.

The other people left for the other gang. The leaders encouraged me to stay so I stayed with the other members. I couldn’t hide my sadness in front of them, but I just accepted it. I went to the headquarters everyday. It slowly went empty but was full of silence.

A couple of days later, I finally met them again. They said that I was doing great with grinding. I was so happy when hear that. No, I was happy to meet them.

But it happened again... After gladness comes sorrow.

They advised me to join my former gang mates who went to the other gang, a grandiose clan.

I put on a fake smile. I don’t want it.

I said to myself that even though our gang’s not that active, I love it and I don’t want to leave the headquarters but I was hurt that they wanted me to do that so I said good bye to them instead.

They said that they felt bad and were sorry. I asked them to not feel that way and I walked out.

I missed the recycler inside the headquarters and of course, my mates.

But after a few days of enjoying being alone, I can now feel the freedom from the pain I have inside.

I met them again once while looting and they gave gifts to me. I felt bad not joining them but I still went on my own journey.

I traveled by a train around the city finding loot. I met new people and they became very close to my heart in a very short period of time. They leave their gangs and create a new one together. I can’t believe that they can leave their respected gangs so easily.

They are fun to be with. I wanted to be with them too but I can’t be in a gang yet. I promised them I’d join them when I’m ready.

But when I was finally ready to join them, it was too late. We later parted ways. It’s okay because we still see each other every day and promised to have each other’s backs. I celebrated holidays with them. They became my precious friends. I still have contact with my previous gangmates because we still trade items and we’re all on good terms.

Now, I’m building my own gang. It was so peaceful.
