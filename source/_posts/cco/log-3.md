After that night, I did not see ████████ again. I messaged him, and he responded two or three days later. He explained that he couldn't come since he was too busy with his academics. I told him that it was fine because his studies were more important. He promised to try whenever he had free time, but that day never came.

One day, I came upon an advertisement on a public server concerning "the future of Shangri-La". I joined their private server out of curiousity.

After being greeted by their counselor, I met their commander a few days later. He assisted me in creating files on the server. They have several monetary systems and such.

The commander told me that in order to continue on their server and secure Shangri-La's future, I needed to join a strong gang. Then, I remembered having met someone a long time ago. She leads a vast gang. I'm not sure if they're powerful, but she's also on the private server. I recognized her username, so I contacted her. I explained everything and she warmly welcomed me to the gang.

Then I discovered that her gang was quite kind and loved to "help other people". I'm happy that I joined her gang since my worries began to fade after that day. I will talk about those worries later. Back on the private server, there are four factions. I'm not going to list them all. I'll only post about the faction that I joined.

So I joined the faction called "███████ ██████". They are mostly from ██████ District and are all people in business. As a member, I am required to work for three hours at ███████ Bank. The rate is acceptable, and I can eat one of my favorite foods, pork adobo, at a nearby restaurant.

Wait, I forgot I had to change my backpack. Sorry, but I have to leave to recycle tech scraps now. 'Till next time.
