excerpt: "My inventory was overflowing, my routine was stuck, and Shangri-La City was closing in. I thought I joined a gang just to use a tech recycler, but I quickly realized I was doing more than just clearing space—I was coming home to the legacy I helped build. From an inventory crisis to a long-awaited homecoming, here’s how I found my rhythm again."

In my last post, "[Pointless and Tagless](/cco/pointless-and-tagless)," I was pretty set on staying solo for a while. I wanted to find my purpose before committing to a new tag. But as it turns out, the reality of life in Shangri-La City had other plans for me.

## The Inventory Crisis

My inventory was overflowing with `Medical Tech Scraps` (MTS), and without a tech recycler, I couldn't do my normal routine. I was stuck.

For those who scavenge, you know the drill—once your bags are full, your routine grinds to a halt. You can't keep wandering the city when you have no room for anything new.

I needed a tech recycler. It’s the only efficient way to turn those MTS into `Tech Scraps` (TS) and keep moving.

## Coming Home to Nousagi

I reached out to `Xythran` to see if I could use their facilities, but the rule was clear: I had to be a member of `Nousagi [NSG]`.

While the inventory issue was the "spark" that made me join on February 7th, the truth is that `[NSG]` has always been close to my heart. I was there when the gang was born. Alongside `Chief_Marauder` and `Ain_sel`, I helped teach the founder, `Skae_19`, everything he needed to know to survive this city.

At that time, `En_Roise` was `Skae_19`’s right-hand. When `Skae_19` eventually left, `En_Roise` took over the leadership and expanded the gang's reach. That was when `Xythran` and `Azhulong31` joined, becoming her right and left-hand men. Though only `Xythran` remains by her side now, the legacy they built is still standing.

So, while I joined because I had work to do, it feels right to be back with friends who I’ve known since the very beginning.

## Back to the Grind

Once I had the `[NSG]` tag, I finally got to work. I spent the entire week in a steady rhythm:

- Recycling MTS into `Tech Scraps` (TS).
- Using the TS to craft backpacks.
- Heading back out to scavenge for more.

It’s been a busy week of clearing out the clutter and getting my journey back on track. It wasn't exactly the "grand purpose" I was looking for, but it kept me productive.
