<!-- ðŸ’ª Grinding To Make Money -->

Living independently is not easy. I'm studying while making money to support myself. Aside from my grades, I worry about paying the bills, what to eat and drink, cleaning the house, being healthy and productive, and making profit wherever I go. To be honest, I can't believe I'm able survive everyday.

<!-- ðŸ’° Use Money To Buy Points -->

Slowly but surely, I grind and grind to make millions of dollars. I studied about the **Points Market** and then, bought 25 points. I went to haitus for 46 days and then started to grind again.

<!-- ðŸŽ« Use Points To Unlock Stock Ticketer -->
<!-- ðŸ“ˆ Invest In The Stock Market -->

Yesterday, I withdrawed 3 million from **Cayman Island's Bank**, returned home, and bought 60 points from the Points Market. I exchanged 50 points for a **Stock Ticker** and I studied about **Torn City Stock Exchange**. Then today, I bought 400,000+ worth of shares from **West Side University**.

<!-- â›³ Goals -->

My goal is to buy 1 million shares. That is worth more than 93 million dollars. It gives +10% education course time reduction.
