excerpt: "I’ve been asking myself a hundred times: 'Why am I doing this?' Between the feeling of burnout and the sudden news that my gang has been dissolved, I've found myself both pointless and tagless. This is an honest update on my journey in CCO and my search for a reason to keep going."

## Finding My Way Back

After my [last post](/cco/Ahoy/) 3 years ago, I tried to keep up with this [log series](/cco/categories/logs/), but I’ll be honest: staying motivated has been a struggle. I’ve found myself asking, "Why am I doing this? What’s the purpose?"

I keep reminding myself that these logs are meant to document my journey in [CyberCode Online](https://cybercodeonline.com), but real-life responsibilities keep pulling me away. There’s a constant voice in my head telling me I should be focusing on "other things" instead. I even finished a 4th log last year, but I left it in my drafts; at the time, it just didn't feel like there was any point in hitting publish.

## A Long Hiatus

I was on and off with CCO throughout last year. I played until about July 2025, but after reaching out to my friend `En_Roise` when she returned, I ended up taking another long break.

## Reconnecting with the Community

Things changed on December 24th. My twin brother, `Chief_Marauder`, invited me to `Chiiims`’ Discord server, which aims to gather all the Filipino players from CCO. I decided to join, and to my surprise, I won a giveaway on the 30th! I logged back into the game the next day to claim my prize.

## The End of an Era

When I met up with `Chief_Marauder` to receive the prize, I noticed he was wearing the `[RAT]` tag. When I asked if he had switched gangs, he gave me the bad news: `CyBunnies [BUN]` has been dissolved. I hadn't even realized I was tagless until that moment. After he caught me up on everything that happened, I later shared the news on [GamerProfiles](https://gamerprofiles.com/gamer/k4lm3d/post/HyUabgNcdRo9Rm3bo6NVtx):

> 5 years worth of upkeep is all gone! 😕
>
> Our gang leader, **krolik**, deleted his account yesterday. He forgot to transfer the leadership to **BasedBunny** before deleting it. This causes our gang, **CyBunnies [BUN]** to dissolved.
>
> **DexterHuang**, the developer said that we can create a new one but he can only restore the level, not everything (resources, funds, members).
>
> Right now, some of us hopped to other gangs temporarily, while the rest (including me) were tagless (no gang).

I asked `Chief_Marauder` yesterday if there were any updates on trying to rebuild, but he said there wasn’t much point. Without the accumulated resources and funds, starting over from scratch feels like too much of a hassle for everyone involved.

While I understand their perspective, I can’t help but feel deeply saddened. I valued `[BUN]` so much. Knowing that five years of history vanished in an instant makes it even harder to find the motivation to keep going.

## Moving Forward

I’ve been planning to write an update on my CCO journey since last year, but I kept procrastinating. Today, I finally decided it was time to just sit down and do it.

As for what’s next, `Chief_Marauder` recently joined `Meow_Cafe [8_8]`, along with `Chiiims` and several others. They’ve invited me to join them, but for now, I’m remaining tagless. I’ve been thinking about joining [`Nousagi [NSG]`](https://nsg.is-local.org), but I’m still waiting to hear back from `En_Roise` before I make a final decision.

I’m still searching for that spark—the reason to keep documenting this journey. For now, I’m just taking it one step at a time. I hope that as I continue to hang around the community, I’ll eventually find the purpose I'm looking for. I hope you'll stick around and wish me luck in finding it.
