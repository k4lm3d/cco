I told one of my friends that I would be in a gang with him. But I changed my mind later on as I realized that I do not want to rely that much on anyone ever again, even to a friend. So I started my own gang. I named it ███████ ███ █████ [███]. I was doing very well all by myself.

Yesterday, I renamed it to █████ ████████ [███]. And then I met a stranger who later told me that he wanted to join my gang. I don’t really know what I should do. Before we met, my mind was a bit messed up. I didn’t get much sleep because of farming and the thoughts of joining my friends’ gang also often come through my mind.

But I don’t know why... I feel like I was in front of a mirror. A novice just like me before was in front of me now. I feel like I wanted to help him out so I welcomed him in.
