Nothing special, just wanna share my journey and my friends’ at one of the busiest cities in the continent with y’all. That’s it for now guys. Needed to go for some gang duties.","link":"/cco/Ahoy/"},{"title":"Log #1","text":"I remembered how they invited me to join their gang and welcomed me so happily. I was a novice with no friends back then so I was really glad to talk to them. Something came up to me after that and I wasn’t able to meet them. After two days without contact, I rode a train and went to the headquarters to meet them again. I was so happy until in an instant, everything has changed. The other people left for the other gang. The leaders encouraged me to stay so I stayed with the other members. I couldn’t hide my sadness in front of them, but I just accepted it. I went to the headquarters everyday. It slowly went empty but was full of silence. A couple of days later, I finally met them again. They said that I was doing great with grinding. I was so happy when hear that. No, I was happy to meet them. But it happened again… After gladness comes sorrow. They advised me to join my former gang mates who went to the other gang, a grandiose clan. I put on a fake smile. I don’t want it. I said to myself that even though our gang’s not that active, I love it and I don’t want to leave the headquarters but I was hurt that they wanted me to do that so I said good bye to them instead. They said that they felt bad and were sorry. I asked them to not feel that way and I walked out. I missed the recycler inside the headquarters and of course, my mates. But after a few days of enjoying being alone, I can now feel the freedom from the pain I have inside. I met them again once while looting and they gave gifts to me. I felt bad not joining them but I still went on my own journey. I traveled by a train around the city finding loot. I met new people and they became very close to my heart in a very short period of time. They leave their gangs and create a new one together. I can’t believe that they can leave their respected gangs so easily. They are fun to be with. I wanted to be with them too but I can’t be in a gang yet. I promised them I’d join them when I’m ready. But when I was finally ready to join them, it was too late. We later parted ways. It’s okay because we still see each other every day and promised to have each other’s backs. I celebrated holidays with them. They became my precious friends. I still have contact with my previous gangmates because we still trade items and we’re all on good terms. Now, I’m building my own gang. It was so peaceful.","link":"/cco/log-1/"},{"title":"Log #2","text":"I told one of my friends that I would be in a gang with him. But I changed my mind later on as I realized that I do not want to rely that much on anyone ever again, even to a friend. So I started my own gang. I named it ███████ ███ █████ [███]. I was doing very well all by myself. Yesterday, I renamed it to █████ ████████ [███]. And then I met a stranger who later told me that he wanted to join my gang. I don’t really know what I should do. Before we met, my mind was a bit messed up. I didn’t get much sleep because of farming and the thoughts of joining my friends’ gang also often come through my mind. But I don’t know why… I feel like I was in front of a mirror. A novice just like me before was in front of me now. I feel like I wanted to help him out so I welcomed him in.","link":"/cco/log-2/"},{"title":"Log #3","text":"After that night, I did not see ████████ again. I messaged him, and he responded two or three days later. He explained that he couldn’t come since he was too busy with his academics. I told him that it was fine because his studies were more important. He promised to try whenever he had free time, but that day never came. One day, I came upon an advertisement on a public server concerning “the future of Shangri-La”. I joined their private server out of curiousity. After being greeted by their counselor, I met their commander a few days later. He assisted me in creating files on the server. They have several monetary systems and such. The commander told me that in order to continue on their server and secure Shangri-La’s future, I needed to join a strong gang. Then, I remembered having met someone a long time ago. She leads a vast gang. I’m not sure if they’re powerful, but she’s also on the private server. I recognized her username, so I contacted her. I explained everything and she warmly welcomed me to the gang. Then I discovered that her gang was quite kind and loved to “help other people”. I’m happy that I joined her gang since my worries began to fade after that day. I will talk about those worries later. Back on the private server, there are four factions. I’m not going to list them all. I’ll only post about the faction that I joined. So I joined the faction called “███████ ██████”. They are mostly from ██████ District and are all people in business. As a member, I am required to work for three hours at ███████ Bank. The rate is acceptable, and I can eat one of my favorite foods, pork adobo, at a nearby restaurant. Wait, I forgot I had to change my backpack. Sorry, but I have to leave to recycle tech scraps now. ‘Till next time.","link":"/cco/log-3/"},{"title":"Remote Stall","text":"Since the items inside my stall at the player’s market (in-game) won’t last long, I’ve created a remote tunnel connection to access and sell my items.

A week ago, the curriculum changed. They added to two (2) more courses related to aiding the increase of email frauds (See Crimes 2.0: Scamming) which will take 21 days to finish. “Digital crime statistics provided by the Torn City Police Department have revealed that seven out of four people have been financially impacted by an online scam within the past month.”&mdash;sugarvalves, Torn City Times, on 27/08/24 See the article: Scamming On The Rise In Torn City Reflecting on this journey, I am filled with a mix of emotions&mdash;excitement, anticipation, and a touch of nostalgia. It feels like just yesterday that I was stepping onto campus for the first time, filled with dreams and uncertainties. Now, after countless late nights, projects, and moments of self-doubt, I can see the culmination of my hard work approaching. Each course I have taken has contributed to my growth, not just edcationally but personally as well. These skills will undoubtedly serve me well in the future, no matter where my career takes me. As I embark on these final courses, I am reminded of the importance of staying focused and motivated. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed with the end so close, but I am determined to finish strong. I plan to embrace every moment, and make the most of the resources available to me. * With no perks, there is a total of 147 days left to acquire Bachelor of Computer Science.

I’m just chilling here at my apartment while writing this. Nothing special, just wanna share my journey at one of the most dangerous cities, Torn City. 🏢 First day, first jobOn my first day, not gonna lie, I’m actually lost. It’s a big city, ya know?! I only heard of Torn City on advertisements and on the news. I came here to study and when I got here, the first thing I did was to find a job. I applied for the army but I failed my interview. Then, I applied to a grocery store and fortunately, I got in as a bagger for a salary of $200 a day. The next day, I quit my job and applied again in the army but this time, my interview was a success and I got the job. My salary is -$50 less compared on being a bagger but it’s fine. I still pressed on. 📚 Being a working studentFor my studies, I joined a Computer Science course. I took the first module, CMT1520: Introduction to Computing. I completed it within a week while I’m in the army. I want to continue the course but my job’s requiring me to be more physical so I change course. I joined a Self Defence course but I just wanna take the first module, DEF1700: Introduction to Self Defence. I don’t wanna learn martial arts or sports on the next modules so I change course again soon after I finished it. My next course is a Combat Training course. This time I want to finish it. It has 11 modules. After that, I will go back and finish my first course which is Computer Science. ⚒ My hard work finally payed offAlthough my salary is okay in the army, it’s not enough so in between my studies and work, I sell some stuff so that I can go to gym and buy new clothes. I also do a lot of missions for George. I met him in the city. It took me 13 days to finished all of that for more money. He is a good friend though. After 12 days in the army, I got a job offer from a Private Security Firm to be a Security Contractor. I’m so blessed because the salary is $50k a day. It’s way way more money compared to my daily salary on my previous jobs. I, actually, can’t believe it but I quit my job and after I got my first day salary at the firm, I’m super happy. I bought an apartment worth $25k and do some modifications in it&mdash;an upgrade worth $12.5k. Now, I only have to pay $25 daily for the upkeep. Oops! I still want to go on but I need to go to work now. ‘Till next time 👋","link":"/torn/first-step/"},{"title":"From Battlefield to Bazaar: My Journey as an Army General and Torn Tycoon","text":"Hi again!

I’m studying while making money to support myself. Aside from my grades, I worry about paying the bills, what to eat and drink, cleaning the house, being healthy and productive, and making profit wherever I go. To be honest, I can’t believe I’m able survive everyday. Slowly but surely, I grind and grind to make millions of dollars. I studied about the Points Market and then, bought 25 points. I went to haitus for 46 days and then started to grind again. Yesterday, I withdrawed 3 million from Cayman Island’s Bank, returned home, and bought 60 points from the Points Market. I exchanged 50 points for a Stock Ticker and I studied about Torn City Stock Exchange. Then today, I bought 400,000+ worth of shares from West Side University. My goal is to buy 1 million shares. That is worth more than 93 million dollars. It gives +10% education course time reduction.","link":"/torn/investing-in-the-stock-market/"},{"title":"I Received Educational Support From Our Faction Leader","text":"I recently had the opportunity to chat with our faction leader, Inf3xshun [2836504](). We discussed about making money, doing business (buy and sell), and making profit through investments. Donator PackFeeling confident in my gameplay, I decided to invest in a donator pack. After consulting with Inf3xshun, I withdrew $20 million from our faction’s bank and $9 million from Caymans Island’s Bank. He believed that the donator pack would provide significant benefits and enhance my overall experience. Warring Other Factions: A Profitable StrategyShun also recommended warring other factions as a lucrative way to generate profits. While this strategy involves risks, he emphasized the potential rewards. Now, I’m more eager to contribute to our faction’s growth. Investment: Stock Market VenturesBeyond my usual activities, I’ve recently invested in West Side University’s stock market as I’ve shared on my previous post. This passive income stream aligns with my long-term goals and offers a diversified approach to my finances and education. A Surprising TwistJust when I thought I had a plan, Shun surprised me even further. He sent me a staggering $88 million to invest in West Side University’s stock market. His reasoning was simple: he wanted to contribute to my education and help me achieve the +10% education time reduction. Returning the FavorWhile I was initially hesitant to accept such a large sum, I realized that Inf3xshun’s generosity was genuine. I accepted the money, invested in WSU stocks, and returned the excess funds to him. His trust in me was humbling, and I was determined to make the most of this opportunity. Donator Pack and Faction ContributionsWith the funds I withdrew from CIB, I purchased a donator pack from the market. The perks were substantial, including 60 points and various other benefits. To show my gratitude to the faction, I also donated blood bags, medicines, and drugs. Looking AheadWhile my recent purchases have depleted my funds, I’m excited to see the benefits they bring. I’ll need to grind and make money to replenish my bank account, but I’m confident that my investments will pay off in the long run. My experience with our leader has been truly inspiring. His generosity and support have strengthened my commitment to our faction and motivated me to strive for greater achievements in Torn City. I’m grateful for the opportunities and challenges that this virtual world has presented, and I look forward to what the future holds. Thanks for your generosity, Leader Shun!
