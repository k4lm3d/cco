{"posts":[{"title":"Ahoy!","text":"Name’s K4LM3D. I’m right here at our headquarters, recycling some items into scraps. Nothing special, just wanna share my journey and my friends’ at one of the busiest cities in the continent with y’all. That’s it for now guys. Needed to go for some gang duties.","link":"/cco/Ahoy/"},{"title":"Log #2","text":"I told one of my friends that I would be in a gang with him. But I changed my mind later on as I realized that I do not want to rely that much on anyone ever again, even to a friend. So I started my own gang. I named it ███████ ███ █████ [███]. I was doing very well all by myself. Yesterday, I renamed it to █████ ████████ [███]. And then I met a stranger who later told me that he wanted to join my gang. I don’t really know what I should do. Before we met, my mind was a bit messed up. I didn’t get much sleep because of farming and the thoughts of joining my friends’ gang also often come through my mind. But I don’t know why… I feel like I was in front of a mirror. A novice just like me before was in front of me now. I feel like I wanted to help him out so I welcomed him in.","link":"/cco/log-2/"},{"title":"Log #1","text":"I remembered how they invited me to join their gang and welcomed me so happily. I was a novice with no friends back then so I was really glad to talk to them. Something came up to me after that and I wasn’t able to meet them. After two days without contact, I rode a train and went to the headquarters to meet them again. I was so happy until in an instant, everything has changed. The other people left for the other gang. The leaders encouraged me to stay so I stayed with the other members. I couldn’t hide my sadness in front of them, but I just accepted it. I went to the headquarters everyday. It slowly went empty but was full of silence. A couple of days later, I finally met them again. They said that I was doing great with grinding. I was so happy when hear that. No, I was happy to meet them. But it happened again… After gladness comes sorrow. They advised me to join my former gang mates who went to the other gang, a grandiose clan. I put on a fake smile. I don’t want it. I said to myself that even though our gang’s not that active, I love it and I don’t want to leave the headquarters but I was hurt that they wanted me to do that so I said good bye to them instead. They said that they felt bad and were sorry. I asked them to not feel that way and I walked out. I missed the recycler inside the headquarters and of course, my mates. But after a few days of enjoying being alone, I can now feel the freedom from the pain I have inside. I met them again once while looting and they gave gifts to me. I felt bad not joining them but I still went on my own journey. I traveled by a train around the city finding loot. I met new people and they became very close to my heart in a very short period of time. They leave their gangs and create a new one together. I can’t believe that they can leave their respected gangs so easily. They are fun to be with. I wanted to be with them too but I can’t be in a gang yet. I promised them I’d join them when I’m ready. But when I was finally ready to join them, it was too late. We later parted ways. It’s okay because we still see each other every day and promised to have each other’s backs. I celebrated holidays with them. They became my precious friends. I still have contact with my previous gangmates because we still trade items and we’re all on good terms. Now, I’m building my own gang. It was so peaceful.","link":"/cco/log-1/"},{"title":"Log #3","text":"After that night, I did not see ████████ again. I messaged him, and he responded two or three days later. He explained that he couldn’t come since he was too busy with his academics. I told him that it was fine because his studies were more important. He promised to try whenever he had free time, but that day never came. One day, I came upon an advertisement on a public server concerning “the future of Shangri-La”. I joined their private server out of curiousity. After being greeted by their counselor, I met their commander a few days later. He assisted me in creating files on the server. They have several monetary systems and such. The commander told me that in order to continue on their server and secure Shangri-La’s future, I needed to join a strong gang. Then, I remembered having met someone a long time ago. She leads a vast gang. I’m not sure if they’re powerful, but she’s also on the private server. I recognized her username, so I contacted her. I explained everything and she warmly welcomed me to the gang. Then I discovered that her gang was quite kind and loved to “help other people”. I’m happy that I joined her gang since my worries began to fade after that day. I will talk about those worries later. Back on the private server, there are four factions. I’m not going to list them all. I’ll only post about the faction that I joined. So I joined the faction called “███████ ██████”. They are mostly from ██████ District and are all people in business. As a member, I am required to work for three hours at ███████ Bank. The rate is acceptable, and I can eat one of my favorite foods, pork adobo, at a nearby restaurant. Wait, I forgot I had to change my backpack. Sorry, but I have to leave to recycle tech scraps now. ‘Till next time.","link":"/cco/log-3/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[{"name":"Logs","slug":"logs","link":"/cco/categories/logs/"}],"pages":[{"title":"404: Page Not Found","text":"It seems that the page you have requested does not exist or no longer exist.
